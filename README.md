# reminder README

Hello there, this is a simple yet powerful extension to remind you about specific actions which you tend to forget after diving into that huge code of yours!

For instance, if you have to commit and push the code by the end of the day or just log your working hours in JIRA, or just as simple as to drink water, this reminder will help you do that. 

## Features

You will be able to customize the reminder message and the duration too! By default the duration is 1 hour.

To summarize, configurable features: 
1. Set Interval
2. Set Message

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.reminderDuration`: 1 hour
* `myExtension.reminderText`: Hey! Don't forget to push the code before logging out

**Enjoy!**
